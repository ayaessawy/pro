However, it is possible to come close by analysing patterns in global events, discerning their core motivations, and deciphering the signature strategies from the Illuminati playbook which they employ time and time again. </p>
                                                                              <p class="text last-p"> It is now more important than ever that we remain vigilant and informed in all matters regarding the Illuminati as we find ourselves in the midst of an incredibly unique time in human history as technologies which have the potential to drastically change our world have emerged. Technologies which the Illuminati will not hesitate to use against us.

It can most simply be described as:</p>
                                                                                                  <span class="inner-p">To seek continuous development and advancement to ensure that the human race (or another form of consciousness) survives as far into the future as possible.</span>
                                                                            <p class="text">The Illuminati believe that our only real purpose, as it is with all living creatures, is to survive. What sets us apart from the rest of the animal kingdom is that as intelligent beings we know that survival requires more than merely following natural instincts. Long-term survival requires us to advance human knowledge and develop the technologies needed to enable us to survive future cataclysmic events such as a climate collapse, the death of our sun, the end of our galaxy, and perhaps even the eventual demise of the universe itself. </p>
                                                                              <p class="text last-p">There are many who share in this belief and work to do their part to advance human progress. What separates the Illuminati is the extreme lengths to which they will go to serve the higher purpose, not just seeking the expansion of human knowledge, but also pursuing radical<span>advancements of the human</span>  race itself.
